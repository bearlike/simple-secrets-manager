## Quick reference (cont.)

- Where to file issues: <https://github.com/bearlike/simple-secrets-manager/issues>
- Supported architectures: ([more info](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64)) `amd64`, `arm64v8`

## Why does this exist?

Hashi Corp Vault works well but it was meant for enterprises. Therefore, it was heavy and non-portable (atleast difficult) for my homelab setup. So I wanted to build a Secrets Manager intended for small scale setups that could also scale well.

## Goals

- A lightweight system that sucks less power out of the wall. Therefore, minimal background jobs and reduced resource utilizations.
- Should be compatible on both `x86-64` and `arm64v8` (mainly Raspberry Pi 4).
- High stability, availability and easy scalability.

## Available secret engines

| Secret Engine | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `kv`          | Key-Value engine is used to store arbitrary secrets. |

## Available authentication methods

| Auth Methods      | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `userpass`        | Allows users to authenticate using a username and password combination.   |
| `token`           | Allows users to authenticate using a token. Token generation requires users to be authenticated via `userpass`  |

## Getting started

### Automated Install: [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Recommended)

1. Run the [stack](https://github.com/bearlike/simple-secrets-manager/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) by executing `docker-compose up -d`.
2. Stop stack by executing `docker-compose down`

```yaml
version: '3'
volumes:
  mongo_data:

services:
  # From v5.0.0, mongoDB requires atleast ARMv8.2-A microarchitecture to run.
  # So we're going with v4 to improve compatibility on SBCs such as
  # Raspberry Pi 4 and Odroid C2 with ARMv8.0-A
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4
    restart: always
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db
    networks:
      - app-tier

  ssm-app:
    image: krishnaalagiri/ssm:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      CONNECTION_STRING: mongodb://root:password@mongo:27017
      PORT: 5000
    networks:
      - app-tier
